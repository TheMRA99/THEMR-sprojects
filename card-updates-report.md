# RECTO Card Database Audit Report

**Date:** 2026-05-18
**Database file:** `D:\Code\card-optimizer\cards.json`
**Cards audited:** ~40 of 98 (focus on widely-held cards + spot-checks on others)
**Note:** Treat all percentages as the "effective cashback" representation used in cards.json (e.g. 4 mpd ≈ 7.2% at 1.8c/mile). Do not modify cards.json — review and apply selectively.

## Low-confidence / unclear

### HSBC Advance Card (`hsbc-advance`)
- **Currently in cards.json:** 3.5% on dining/grocery/transport/online; min $600/mo; cap $25/cat.
- **Actual (2026):** Current product is 1.5% on first S$2,000, 2.5% above, capped S$70/mo total. No category bonuses. Significant simplification. However, sources are mixed; HSBC Advance banking relationship may unlock different tiers, and the official terms PDF describes the current structure.
- **Source:** https://www.hsbc.com.sg/credit-cards/products/advance/
- **Confidence:** Low (need direct T&C review; product seems to have been simplified)

### OCBC Voyage Premier (`ocbc-premier-voyage`)
- **Currently in cards.json:** 2.3 mpd overseas; 2.5% local across categories.
- **Actual (2026):** 1.6 mpd local, 2.2 mpd overseas. The 2.3 mpd figure is rounded/optimistic. Card is invitation-only Premier banking customers (S$350k+ AUM).

- **Confidence:** Low (only one secondary source — Premier program details vary)

## Suggested NEW cards to add

1. **Standard Chartered Beyond Card** — Premium SC card launched Nov 2024. S$1,635 fee, unlimited lounge access via Priority Pass.
2. **UOB Lady's Solitaire Card** — Premium tier of Lady's; up to 10 mpd on 2 selectable categories.
3. **Mari Credit Card** (MariBank) — 1.5% unlimited, no FX, no annual fee. Worth adding given MariBank presence is growing.
4. **DBS Insignia** — Ultra-premium DBS invitation-only card (Apr 2026 launch per MileLion). Likely out of scope for app's audience but worth noting.
5. **POSB Galaxy AMEX** — Reportedly relaunched/refreshed; verify before adding.

## Suggested DISCONTINUED cards to remove

1. **HSBC Visa Platinum** (`hsbc-visa-plat`) — Closed to new applications 21 Jun 2024; existing cards renamed to HSBC Live+. The `hsbc-visa-plat` entry in cards.json is dead. Remove.
2. **Citi Clear Card** (`citi-clear`) — Still listed as a tertiary student card per Citi but barely promoted; check value of keeping. (Not confirmed discontinued — keep as-is for now if app is comprehensive.)

## Cards verified with NO material changes vs cards.json (sample)
These cards' core terms appear consistent with cards.json — minor fee differences excluded:
- Standard Chartered Simply Cash (`sc-simply-cash`) — 1.5% unlimited confirmed.
- CIMB AWSM (`cimb-awsm`) — Cards.json shows 8% on dining/online/transport but actual product is 1% unlimited cashback on Dining & Entertainment, Online Shopping, Telco — POSSIBLE DISCREPANCY. Source: https://www.cimb.com.sg/en/personal/banking-with-us/cards/credit-cards/cimb-awsm-card.html — flagging at Medium.
